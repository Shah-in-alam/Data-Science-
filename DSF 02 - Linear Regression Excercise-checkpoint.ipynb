However, it is likely that The seperate budget columns have a different influence on our model. Create a model for each budget column and compare their performance using $R^2$ and the MSE on test data. What do you notice?\n",

However, it might be possible that there is extra value to gain when keeping the columns seperate. Build a single model with three distinct features (TV, Radio and Newspaper). Plot the model and evaluate it using $R^2$. Is this an improvement? Test the model on test data and calculate the MSE. Compare this to our current model. Is there an improvement here?\n",
